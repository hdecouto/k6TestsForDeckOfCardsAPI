Below is a quick summary of the technical prep and what to expect.
API to Test
Please start by reviewing the Deck of Cards API repo:
https://github.com/crobertsbmw/deckofcards
We strongly recommend pulling it down locally (vs. using a hosted version) so you have more flexibility in the load you can administer and the tests you can perform.
Repository Setup
Create a new public GitHub repository
Write a series of performance tests against the Deck of Cards API
Tests must be written in TypeScript using k6
README & Test Plan
Add a README that breaks down your test plan, including:
Your performance testing approach and scenarios
How you’re measuring and evaluating performance for the API
